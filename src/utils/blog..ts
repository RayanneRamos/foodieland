Unlike cooking, which allows for more flexibility and improvisation, baking relies on exact ratios between ingredients.

        postAnswers:
          "One of the most visible impacts of climate change on global food supplies is the effect it has on crop yields. Studies show that extreme heat, drought, and irregular rainfall patterns can significantly reduce crop production. Staple crops like wheat, rice, and corn are particularly vulnerable, leading to a decline in overall agricultural productivity. As yields drop, prices rise, making food less affordable for many people around the world.",

In some regions, crops are maturing too early or too late due to unpredictable weather patterns. This disrupts the timing of harvests, reducing the availability of fresh produce and leading to food shortages. In some areas, farmers may struggle to adapt their farming methods to the new climate realities.",
